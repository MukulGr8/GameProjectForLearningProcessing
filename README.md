# GameProjectForLearningProcessing
*Implementing some Data Structures in Real Life*
These are some Games which I have made while learning processing language in object oriented manner, and I cant make the source code public becuase it took so much effort to learn to make a game. A game designer can understand my efforts :) but I can show damn proof that these are made by me

# 1. Bullet box2d Game <h1>
In this game I have used box2d to control the behaviour of the bullet, When the user presses the space button it shoots bullets towards the 
boxes which are also a physics body same as bullet.

**P.S This was just to learn to implement the box2d Game**

# 2. Tic Tac Toe Game <h1>
This is just a simple tic tac toe game made using a 2D Array to store the object Square (This includes when to draw cross and circle )

**P.S This was to learn the implementation of oject oriented programming**

# 3. Snake Game <h1>
A snake game created to learn the ArrayList behaviour on the objects to add the box to the tail of the Snake whenever it eats a food item.

**P.S Snake Game for Learning the ArrayList with Objects**

# 4. Pass the Bars <h1>
Actually I came through this idea of the game that tha balls are falling from the sky of different colors and you can only get the points 
if and only if your bar color matches the ball color, and you can change the bar color by arrow key up and down.

**P.S Pass the bar to check for the collision wihtout box2d**

# 5. Connect 4 <h1>
All you have to do is in this game is that when you tap on a grid in the board, a ball will appear and will move till last index if there is no ball under it in the column, the first player to make 4 connected balls in row, column or diagonal will win the game.
Logic for checking win is not written yet becuase i was working on some other projects.
Here ball is referenced as square.

**P.S Implementing connect 4 was not easy at all, but was fun and cool task**

# 6. Connect 4 <h1>
A frogger game wher a frog have to reach to the top of the window by moving up down left and right and without touching the car, these
car are in layers and have different speed

**P.S Love with object oriented programming**

# 7. Flappy bird <h1>
As every game programmer want to design the classic flappy bird game, so did I :) but i did this using box2d for controlling the gravity 
of the bird and then collision of the bird with the pipes.

**P.S In this game I learned to replace the objects with images and learned to make never ending game**

# 8. Space Invaders <h1>
This game was designed to learn the removal of elements after collision, like removing a bullet and the enemy from the game when
the bullet touches the enemy, this was also done with box2d in the same enviornement.

**P.S I have learned a lot in this game like removal of objects while in draw after collision**

# 9. Gravity Based Game <h1>
This was a very fun task to do, Actually I want to make a game with some levels, In that where enemy can kill the player and the player have to 
reach the goal, to go to next level. Here Redsquare will decrease the health of the player blue ball, and yellowsquare will decrease the size of the goal
which is green in color and if player reaches to it then the player will go to next level, I have used box2d in making this game and every object and level are made 
from scratch as usual. 
*If you think you cant find out what's happneing in the game then please download the video file attached.*

**P.S This was my best project to learn and implement every single thing which I have learned in processing.**
